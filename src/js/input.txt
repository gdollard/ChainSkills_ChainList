Hi
According to the formal definition established by International Telecommunication Union [1], the Internet of Things (IoT) refers to a world 
composed of networked physical objects, where every- thing potentially has a unique identifier and can interact and cooperate with each other 
r com- mon goals. With the rapid development of information technologies and manufacturing of smart devices, IoT has become a critical technology to enable a wide 
variety of devices to communicate and share data with each other. It is anticipated that there will be over 20 billion devices, rangi
Fabric is a modular and extensible open-source system for deploying
and operating permissioned blockchains and one of the Hyperledger
projects hosted by the Linux Foundation (www.hyperledger.org).
Fabric is the first truly extensible blockchain system for running
distributed applications. It supports modular consensus protocols,
which allows the system to be tailored to particular use cases and
trust models. Fabric is also the first blockchain system that runs
distributed applications written in standard, general-purpose pro-
gramming languages, without systemic dependency on a native
cryptocurrency. This stands in sharp contrast to existing block-
chain platforms that require “smart-contracts” to be written in
domain-specific languages or rely on a cryptocurrency. Fabric real-
izes the permissioned model using a portable notion of membership,
which may be integrated with industry-standard identity manage-
ment. To support such flexibility, Fabric introduces an entirely novel
blockchain design and revamps the way blockchains cope with non-
determinism, resource exhaustion, and performance attacks.
This paper describes Fabric, its architecture, the rationale be-
hind various design decisions, its most prominent implementation
aspects, as well as its distributed application programming model.
We further evaluate Fabric by implementing and benchmarking
a Bitcoin-inspired digital currency. W
